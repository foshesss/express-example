# Example Multi-Page Web Application w/ Express
This is an example repository showcasing how to serve multiple different pages with 
an express application. There are a bunch of ways to go about this, but this uses methods that were learned in class (INST377 @ UMD).

This project has been deployed on Vercel. You can view it live here at this link ( https://express-example-blond.vercel.app/ ).

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to show off class concepts that might be useful for the final project. These include:
- How to use an external library in a served page (about.js, about.html)
- How to touch an API within a served page (catalog.js)
- How to modify HTML of elements on a served page (home.js, catalog.js)
- How to serve multiple pages and create your own API endpoint (index.js)

There are a ton of comments in each file, which explain the purpose of each file in this repo.

## How to use locally (useful commands)
- Install dependencies (do this after you clone the repo): `npm i`
- Start the web application: `npm start`
- Stop the web application: CTRL + C in your terminal
